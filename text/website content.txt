With Us, It’s All About Flavor 

Hand-crafted, slow-cooked, flame-grilled. Flavor is who we are and what we do.
Kansas City’s favorite Mexican restaurant since 1968!

Margarita’s Mexican Cuisine was founded in 1968 by Mexican-born restaurateur 
Norberto Rodriguez with the goal of introducing authentic Mexican cuisine to 
the greater Kansas City area. The restaurant was an immediate success and to 
satisfy growing customer demand, our current location on Main Street in 
Rock Hill was founded in 1977 in one of the area’s most historic buildings 
which dates all the way back to the 1860’s.
